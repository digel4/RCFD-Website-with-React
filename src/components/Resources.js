                    RCF-D Spotlight: Craig Humpston, Illustrator – Puny Future

                </div>
                <div className="youtubeSectionDescription body-copy-black">
                    This film shows the creation of a page from a work in progress 'Puny Future'. A short story about a post-Earth civilisation where creatures have been bred to act as biological computers. Inevitable calamity ensues!  Graphic artist and illustrator Craig Humpston draws influence from cartoon, comics and 80's skate art in his outlandish miasmic emissions. Meandering between creating stories in comics, character design and stand-alone pieces, his work uses digital tools to help develop hand drawn or painted outcomes.
